	python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.matplotlib_fname())"

^^^this shows where the matplotlibrc file is
to change the logging level of tensorflow gpu, which supresses the output related to its functionality, create and edit a .bashrc file for
the conda environment you are working in

	vim /home/NETID/bodhik/miniconda3/envs/python39/.bashrc
		export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=3
		export MPLBACKEND=qtagg

and in the file with the tensorflow code:
	...
	import matplotlib
	matplotlib.use("qtagg")
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	...
