	python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.matplotlib_fname())"

^^^this shows where the matplotlibrc file is
to change the logging level of tensorflow gpu, which supresses the output related to its functionality, create and edit a .bashrc file for
the conda environment you are working in

	vim /home/NETID/bodhik/miniconda3/envs/python39/.bashrc
		export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=3
		export MPLBACKEND=qtagg

and in the file with the tensorflow code:
	...
	import matplotlib
	matplotlib.use("qtagg")
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	...	

to make an automatic ssh connection without the need for a password

create an ssh key pair to use instead of a password:
	
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
	store file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa_kaczmarz
	leave the other two options blank! (hit enter twice)

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_kaczmarz.pub NETID@kaczmarz.uwb.edu


test that it worked
	ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_kaczmarz

create an ssh config for the server by adding the following to the file
~/.ssh/config

	Host kaczmarz
		HostName kaczmarz.uwb.edu
		User NETID
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_kaczmarz

save the file and you should only need to type:
	ssh kaczmarz
and be logged in without a password or prompt for one
